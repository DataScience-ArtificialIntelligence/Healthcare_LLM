# LLM Performance Comparison in a Healthcare App

## üìå Project Overview  
This project evaluates the performance of different Large Language Models (LLMs) by integrating them into a healthcare-focused app. The primary goal is not to solve healthcare problems but to apply **software engineering principles** while analyzing LLMs on key performance metrics.  

## üè• Application Use Case  
The app provides **healthcare-related questions** as input to multiple LLMs (both local and cloud-based) to compare their performance.  

## üéØ Objectives  
### 1. Define & Implement the App  
- Develop a simple application that sends healthcare-related queries to various LLMs.  
- Support both **cloud-based** APIs (e.g., OpenAI, Gemini, Claude) and **local models** (e.g., Hugging Face).  

### 2. Integrate & Compare Multiple LLMs  
- Use different LLMs from:  
  - **Cloud**: ChatGPT (OpenAI), Gemini (Google), Claude (Anthropic).  
  - **Local**: Models from Hugging Face, running on different hardware setups.  

### 3. Test Across Devices & Conditions  
- Run tests on **different devices** (laptop, cloud VM, mobile, edge devices).  
- Evaluate models under **varying network conditions** to assess real-world performance.  

### 4. Measure Key Performance Metrics  
- **Response Time**: How quickly the model generates a response.  
- **Accuracy & Relevance**: Compare responses against standard answers.  
- **Resource Usage**: Measure CPU, RAM, and GPU consumption.  
- **Latency Issues**: Identify delays in response delivery.  

### 5. Data Collection & Visualization  
- Gather data from multiple test cases.  
- Use **graphs, charts, and tables** to present findings.  

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack  
- **Backend**: Python (FastAPI/Flask)  
- **Frontend**: React.js (Optional, for UI)  
- **Database**: PostgreSQL/MongoDB (for storing test results)  
- **Cloud APIs**: OpenAI, Google Gemini, Anthropic Claude  
- **Local LLMs**: Hugging Face models (via Transformers library)  
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly  

## üìä Expected Outcomes  
- A **detailed performance comparison** of cloud-based vs. local LLMs.  
- Insights into **software engineering best practices** for LLM integration.  
- **Visualization dashboards** showcasing LLM performance.  

## üöÄ Future Enhancements  
- Expand to other domains (e.g., **education**, **finance**).  
- Add **more LLMs** as they become available.  
- Improve **benchmarking framework** for deeper analysis.
